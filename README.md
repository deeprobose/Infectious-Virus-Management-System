Database Project Name: **Infectious Viruses Management System **

1. What information does this database hold?

The database holds fictious information regarding certain infectious viruses, including their characteristics, associated countries, reported cases, available vaccines, research studies and many more. Its aim is to centralize and manage data for better understanding, analysis, and response to viral outbreaks. 

2. What is the purpose of maintaining such an extensive database? 

The purpose of this database is multifold. Each purpose has been listed below: 

a. Serves as a centralized repository of information that can be accessed by researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers.
b. Facilitates monitoring and tracking the spread of viruses, understanding their transmission modes, symptoms, and prevention methods.
c. Captures data on reported cases, helping to analyze the impact of viruses on different countries and populations.
d. Stores information about vaccines developed for specific viruses, providing insights into their efficacy, side effects, and research institutions involved. 
e. Maintains data on testing labs and quarantine facilities, aiding in efficient testing, diagnosis, and containment measures.

3. What information does each table hold in this database? 

Below is brief of what information each table holds:

a. The Viruses table contains details about different viruses, including their names, descriptions, transmission modes, symptoms, and prevention methods.
b. The Countries table provides information about various countries, including their names, continents, populations, government types, and healthcare systems.
c. The Cases table records reported cases of viruses in different countries, including the date reported, case type, and case count.
d. The Vaccines table stores information about vaccines developed for specific viruses, such as their names, development status, efficacy, side effects, and associated research institutions.
e. The Research table captures research studies conducted on viruses, including researcher names, research institutions, research topics, publication dates, and findings.
f. The Travel_Advisories table contains travel advisories issued for specific countries due to viral outbreaks, including advisory levels, dates, and detailed information.
g. The Testing_Labs table maintains data on testing labs available in different countries, including lab names, types, testing capacities, and contact information.
h. The Quarantine_Facilities table tracks the availability of quarantine facilities in different countries, including facility names, types, capacities, and locations.

4. What is the impact of this database in the real world?

This database plays a crucial role in real-world scenarios by centralizing vital information about infectious viruses. It empowers researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers with comprehensive data for effective decision-making, monitoring virus spread, developing vaccines, and implementing timely interventions. By promoting collaboration and knowledge sharing, this database contributes to global efforts in preventing and controlling infectious diseases, ultimately saving lives and safeguarding public health.
